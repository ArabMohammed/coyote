\section{\system Overview}\label{sec:overview}
\system is a staging compiler for Python.
The runtime provides a \texttt{CoyoteVar} datatype which represents a symbolic encrypted value, and supports addition, subtraction, and multiplication.
Python code that manipulates these symbolic variables produces an arithmetic circuit representation of the program, which \system then compiles into a set of vector primitives that can be further lowered into C++ code that targets Microsoft's SEAL backend for BFV \raghav{(citation needed)}.

\milind{You should put the step-by-step procedure for coyote here, then describe them in more detail: break the computation down into aligned subgraphs, assigning scheduling slots, choosing lanes. This is also a good place for a picture explaining these steps: show a tree, show picking bits of a tree, show moving when the computations happen around, show lane assignment}

In this section, we give a brief overview of the steps Coyote takes to vectorize an arbitrary arithmetic circuit.
We will use the circuit in Figure~\ref{fig:small-expr-circuit} that computes $(ab+c)(xy+z)$ as a running example.
The compilation proceeds as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Coyote first identifies highly vectorizable subcircuits (shown highlighted in Figure~\ref{fig:small-expr-circuit})
    \item These subcircuits are pulled out and aligned to produce a single vectorized computation, which is then inserted back into the original program, resulting in the circuit in Figure~\ref{fig:partially-vectorized-circuit}. 
    This process amounts to essentially precomputing part of the program, and is repeated until no more subcircuits can be found. 
    At this point, the scalar computation has been split into multiple phases, as seen in Figure~\ref{fig:code-split-phases}, and each phase has been vectorized separately.
    \item The new circuit is converted to a vector {\em schedule} (Figure~\ref{fig:vector-sched-needing-rotates}), which amounts to assigning a {\em lane} (horizontal position) and {\em schedule slot} (vertical position) to each original scalar instruction.
    \item Notice that in the schedule, the scalar \texttt{\%3} is computed on lane 2, but used in lane 1. To correct this discrepancy, Coyote inserts an additional instruction to create a copy of the \texttt{[\%1, \%3]} vector with data arranged as \texttt{[\%3, \%1]}, putting \texttt{\%3} on lane 1 where it is used.
\end{enumerate}

% \milind{This dives in too quickly; I think the overview thing I laid out above is necessary. Otherwise: what's a stage? What does it mean to schedule subgraphs together? What does it mean to ``line operands up.''}
\raghav{Is this better? I kind of briefly mentioned ``creating a vector schedule'' as a separate thing that needs to happen apart from just picking vectorizable trees, should I say any more or less about that here, before discussing it in detail in Section~\ref{sec:design}?}
% \system reduces the search space for vectorized programs \raghav{Does it make sense to call it ``search space''?} by first splitting the computation into multiple stages, and only allowing for vector rotations to line operands up between stages.
% A stage consists of a set of independent subgraphs of the entire circuit \raghav{Do I need to explain what independent means here?}. 
% The subgraphs are scheduled together, with each one being placed on its own vector lane. 
% Once vector code for a stage has been generated, all of its subgraphs are removed from the circuit, and the subgraphs for the next stage are picked out.
% After the entire circuit has been split up into stages, the subgraphs from each stage are assigned specific vector lanes to minimize the number of distinct rotations required to line up the outputs of one stage with the inputs of the next.
% Finally, \system computes and inserts these rotation instructions between stages and emits the vector code.

\subsection{Backend}\raghav{What more can/should I say here? Is this the right place to mention why we don't use CKKS (cost model constraints)? Is that even relevant to mention?}
Coyote targets the BFV backend for Microsoft SEAL \raghav{(citation needed)}.
