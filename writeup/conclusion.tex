\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}
In this paper, we presented \system, the first vectorizing compiler for arbitrary homomorphic programs that considers FHE's unique cost model for data movement when vectorizing.
We show that \system can automatically vectorize a large class of useful kernels, showing speedups of up to 6$\times$ over scalar code.
